// We want to MODEL an EPICODE student in our JS program.
// To model a real-wolrd entity into your program, first
// you need to think about what are the properties
// of that entity that you need in your program.

// Of an EPICODE student we care about:
// - name
// - surname
// - age
// - if they have a webcam or not

let student = {

  surname: "Smith", // property of the object, of type STRING
  age: 20, // property of the object, of type NUMBER
  hasWebcam: true, // property of the object, of type BOOLEAN
};

// key: value structure, because every property has a KEY and a VALUE
// The order of the properties is not relevant and for JS it doesn't matter.
// This means that you can access a property called 'name', but you
// cannot say "Give me the first property...".

console.log(student);

// it is a structure that cointain more than one value
